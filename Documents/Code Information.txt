Summary:

Rails is the backend and at the same time the main control in which the whole server is instantiated. EmberCLI is also instantiated, but it is under control of ember-cli-rails gem while Ember.js (the frontend) is under EmberCLI.


Server Structure:

-Rails
--Ember-cli-rails
---EmberCLI
----Ember.js

For people forking the project:
1. Review .travis.yml and follow the instructions on Extra Commands to generate new secrets.yml and secrets.yml.enc, and also change or remove the code climate token.

Notes:

package,json on root folder is used by Heroku only! Updates on package.json under frontend must be manually changed on root package.json for proper installation on Heroku.
