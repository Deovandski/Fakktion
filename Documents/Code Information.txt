Summary:

Rails is the backend and at the same time the main control in which the whole server is instantiated. EmberCLI is also instantiated, but it is under control of ember-cli-rails gem while Ember.js (the frontend) is under EmberCLI.


Server Structure:

-Rails
--Ember-cli-rails
---EMberCLI
----Ember.js

For people forking the project:
1. Review .travis.yml and follow the instructions on Extra Commands to generate new secrets.yml and secrets.yml.enc, and also change or remove the code climate token.

Overall Rules:
1. Production environment must be done using HTTPS!

Rails Rules:
1. All Rails related code are located under app folder. For resources, please follow the other implemented resources.
2. All routes must be redirected to EMber.js on Routes.rb
	2.1 All resources must be under :api
3. Do not disable csrf_meta_tags since it can create an easily exploitable vulnerability.

Ember Rules:
1. All Ember related code are located under Frontend/app folder, and all Ember related commands must be done on Frontend folder.
